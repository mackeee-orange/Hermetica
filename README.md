THIS IS NOT WEB FRAMEWORK TO REPLACE FLASK.

Hermetica is scaffold tools, and wiki to implement better flask applications.

When we try to build web applications by using flask web framework, there are to many patterns and practices.
This diversity make it difficult to implement apps that have simple architecture.
In other words, because of too many manners, options, and patters, to implement more bigger applications is not so easy.
(but, to implement small app by using flask is extreamly easy)

Therefor, we try to implement the scaffold tools head for better architecture applications as mach as possible
based on our many experiences.

* better and common directory structure
* scaffold to create tipycal API, model.
* select powerful packages(like SQLAlchemy Nose)

# Installation

We dare to support only python 3.x, because python 2.x will eventually deprecated almost all systems, and we have to get used to python 3.x quickly.

```
pip install hermetica
```

# Usage

comming soon

# Development

This repos is too young, so we provide few useful features yet.
we will grad if you send PRs...

# See Before Wiki (Flask Best Practices)

Why we apply broken change? Because, before repo source code is slightly trivial,
and we believe this change will not cause negative impact to ohters.

To create scaffold tools for flask will cause good affect the world rather than remain trivial code.
But there are no warries. Flask-best-Practices contents (wiki docs) remain here (for japanese).
